Dual Personality compositor

demo - demo <hyde/jeckyll>
Demo Program to show off the functionality of the system as of now.

Abstract:
===============
A proof of concept dual personality rendering engine for both native X11
and for ncurses.

Disclaimer:
===============
The system is very buggy at the moment.
This was all coded during the UB Hackathon 2014 by me personally.

Story Line
===============
The GUI side was written in xlib, not because it was somthing easy for
me, it was somthing challenging and fun. I brought xLib manuals circa
1995 to program it. and once I got the hang of it, well, it's a very
good system to work with. I plan on using it extensively.
